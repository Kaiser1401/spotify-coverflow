SpotifyCoverFlow is a simple script to display a full-screen & high resolution image of your current playing (or most recent) song on Spotify. The intended use is to dedicate a RaspberryPi (or similar device) and a monitor/screen to be an always on digital poster for your favorite music artwork.

At the time of writing this script, Spotify only supports image artwork up to `640x640`. To counteract this - the current song is then searched through iTunes to grab artwork up to `10000x10000`. If the artwork can't be found on iTunes, the lower resolution Spotify artwork will be displayed.
